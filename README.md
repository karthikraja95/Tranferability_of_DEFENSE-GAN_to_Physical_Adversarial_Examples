# DefenseGAN Physical Transferabiltiy

## Abstract

This project discuss the transferability of state
of the art defense techniques for adversarial examples for deep
learning systems in the physical domain. The paper explores
using adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method
(FGSM), Carlini & Wagner (CW) and DeepFool attacks to
generate adversarial images that are given to the classifier as
a digital and physically transformed image. Furthermore, we
present novel results demonstrating the effectiveness of the stateof-the-art Defense-GAN technique to create reconstructions of
images, that have undergone the physical transformation, with a
significant portion of the adversarial noise filtered out. We also
show, that for finer adversarial attacks, that the physical transformation itself causes a high degree of adversarial destruction,
bringing to question the need for additional defenses.
